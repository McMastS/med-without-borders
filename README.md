# MedWithoutBorders
*Med Without Borders* is a non-profit, self-sustaining web service that addresses the lack of essential medicines globally and particularly in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization [(WHO, 2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128112281000236#bib36), pharmaceutical policies govern the framework needed to ensure the efficient and fair access of populations to quality-assured medicines. However, such policies depend on a country's economic level and available resources, therefore, they are mostly suboptimally implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). By facilitating the swift access to necessary medications in a regulated and secure environment, our service helps alleviate the health of patients and saves more lives each day.   

## Criteria
To prevent the abuse of such a service, specific criteria were applied to the selection process of hospitals given access and the permitted essential medicines. This ensures maximum transparency and patient safety, where only internationally accredited hospitals as *Joint Commission International* or JCI-accredited hospitals are allowed to make orders through the service. The hospital registers its accredited doctors, receives their patient's records and doctor-requested orders, as well as officially place orders to deter individual tampering or fraud. Whereas the permitted essential medicines are consistently reviewed and updated with the [WHO Model List of Essential Medicines](http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/) updates. Orders are delivered directly under a priority contract with a fast courier service, as FedEx International Next Flight Service, to secure delivery in under 24 hours.
