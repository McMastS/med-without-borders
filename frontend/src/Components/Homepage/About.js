          The difference between life and death can be a matter of minutes. Our mission is to
          reduce the amount of unnecessary harm caused by lack of crucial medicines at hospitals.
          Our database of medicine inventories at both pharmaceutical suppliers and hospitals
          will allow doctors to save lives across borders, or across streets.
